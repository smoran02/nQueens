Provides a solution to the n x n Superqueens problem in C++.

For an n by n chessboard, this program will determine all possible solutions to the Superqueen problem. A superqueen is a piece in chess that has the combined moves of both the queen and the knight. The n by n Superqueens problem asks for all possible ways to fit n superqueens on an n by n chessboard, where none of the queens can be attacked by any other queen.

This program realistically works for 0 < n < 14.
